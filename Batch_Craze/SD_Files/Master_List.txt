Go the extra mile
One step at a time
As high as a kite
No pain, no gain
A slap on the wrist
It takes two to tango
Feather in your cap
A wolf in sheep’s clothing
Practice what you preach
It’s never too late to mend
Seeing is believing
Catch-22
Nebraska Cornhuskers
In the same boat
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Easy as pie
Love is blind
Better late than never
A blessing in disguise
Actions speak louder than words
Eat your heart out
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Cut corners
Draw the line
Cut to the chase
A taste of your own medicine
As you sow, so shall you reap
At the drop of a hat
The pen is mightier than the sword
Fit as a fiddle
Cut to the chase
Can’t judge a book by its cover
Time is money
Speak of the devil
Don’t give up your day job
Under the weather
Like father, like son
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Jump the gun
Two heads are better than one
By the skin of your teeth
By the skin of your teeth
The grass is always greener on the other side
As quick as a flash
Come what may
Bite off more than you can chew
Leave no stone unturned

Curiosity killed the cat
Ball is in your court
As solid as a rock
Necessity is the mother of invention
Clear as mud
As sweet as sugar
Time heals all wounds
Burn the candle at both ends
Slow and steady wins the race
It’s a small world
God helps those who help themselves
An arm and a leg
A penny saved is a penny earned
Don’t hold your breath
Steal someone’s thunder
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Easy does it
Practice makes perfect
Bend over backward
Swagger
An arm and a leg
A blessing in disguise
Cross that bridge when you come to it
A picture is worth a thousand words
You can’t judge a book by its cover
Apple of my eye
Kill two birds with one stone
Two heads are better than one
You can’t have your cake and eat it too
Feel a bit under the weather
Let bygones be bygones
When pigs fly
All good things must come to an end

As blind as a bat
Let the cat out of the bag
A penny for your thoughts
As plain as day
Money doesn’t grow on trees
Don’t bite the hand that feeds you
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket
Once in a blue moon
Hit the nail on the head
Don’t cry over spilled milk
Barking up the wrong tree
Birds of a feather flock together
Flash in the pan
Hit the books
The grass is always greener on the other side
Let sleeping dogs lie
As easy as pie
Every dog has its day
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Drown your sorrows
The early bird catches the worm
At the drop of a hat
Money can’t buy happiness
As white as snow
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

A drop in the ocean
Between a rock and a hard place
Blood is thicker than water
As easy as pie

Break a leg
Call it a day
Fly by the seat of your pants
The pen is mightier than the sword
Fortune favors the bold
The best of both worlds
Patience is a virtue
Blessing in disguise
No use crying over spilled milk
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Cry over spilled milk
Add insult to injury
Face the music
The pen is mightier than the sword
The elephant in the room
The proof is in the pudding
Fortune favors the bold
Barking up the wrong tree
Bite the bullet
Time flies when you’re having fun
Burning the midnight oil
A piece of cake
Haste makes waste
The icing on the cake
Bite your tongue
As sharp as a tack

When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Cold shoulder
Break the bank
On the ball
A picture is worth a thousand words
Don’t cry over spilled milk
Burst your bubble
Laughter is the best medicine
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch
Once in a lifetime
Time is money
Stomach
Down in the dumps
Andrew Mother Fuckin Hixson
Egg on your face
Out of the blue
Barking up the wrong tree
You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs
All that glitters is not gold
A watched pot never boils
A diamond in the rough
A slap in the face
A storm in a teacup
A taste of things to come
Add fuel to the fire
All in the same boat
All roads lead to Rome
All that jazz
An apple of discord
At your wit’s end
Be glad to see the back of
Beat the clock
Behind the eight ball
Better half
Big fish in a small pond
Bird in the hand
Bite your tongue
Blow your own trumpet
Bolt from the blue
Bring home the bacon
Bring the house down
Burn bridges
Burning question
Bury the hatchet
Bury your head in the sand
By hook or by crook
Can’t hold a candle to
Catch someone red-handed
Chase rainbows
Chew the fat
Clear as a bell
Climb on the bandwagon
Come clean
Come hell or high water
Come rain or shine
Cool as a cucumber
Crack the whip
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Cry wolf
Cut and dried
Cut your losses
Dark horse
Daylight robbery
Dead in the water
Dead ringer
Devil is in the details
Devil’s advocate
Don’t put the cart before the horse
Down and out
Dressed to the nines
Drive someone up the wall
Drop like flies
Drop the ball
Elephant in the room
Every rose has its thorn
Face the facts
Fall by the wayside
Fall off the wagon
Fall on deaf ears
Fan the flames
Feast or famine
Find your feet
Fish out of water
Fly off the handle
Follow your heart
Fools’ paradise
For a song
For all intents and purposes
Forgive and forget
Full of hot air
Get out of hand
Give the cold shoulder
Go against the grain
Go for broke
Go out on a limb
Go the distance
Go to bat for
Go to the dogs
Go with the flow
Good as gold
Grease the wheels
Green with envy
Gut feeling
Half a loaf is better than none
Hand in glove
Hang up your boots
Hard pill to swallow
Have a bone to pick
Have a heart
Have an axe to grind
Have your cake and eat it too
Head in the clouds
Heart of gold
Hit the ground running
Hit the road
Hold your horses
Hold your tongue
Hope against hope
Hot under the collar
In a nutshell
In the heat of the moment
In the nick of time
In the same boat
In the zone
It takes one to know one
It’s a small world
Jack of all trades
Keep a straight face
Keep it under your hat
Keep your fingers crossed
Keep your head above water
Keep your nose clean
Kick the bucket
Kill time
Knee-jerk reaction
Knock on wood
Know the ropes
Know your onions
Last but not least
Last straw
Leave no stone unturned
Let bygones be bygones
Let the cat out of the bag
Light at the end of the tunnel
Like a fish out of water
Like a kid in a candy store
Like a moth to a flame
Like a needle in a haystack
Like father, like son
Live and learn
Lose your touch
Lose your marbles
Mad as a hatter
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Make hay while the sun shines
Make no bones about it
Man of few words
Mark my words
Meet halfway
Move heaven and earth
My cup of tea
My hands are tied
Nip it in the bud
No love lost
No pain, no gain
No strings attached
Not playing with a full deck
Not the sharpest tool in the shed
Not your cup of tea
Off the beaten track
Off the record
Old habits die hard
On a roll
On cloud nine
On the ball
On the fence
On the flip side
On the money
Once in a blue moon
One for the road
One in a million
One man’s trash is another man’s treasure
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Out of the woods
Over the hill
Over the top
Paint the town red
Pass the buck
Pat on the back
Pay the piper
Piece of the pie
Pigs might fly
Play the field
Poke fun at
Pull out all the stops
Pull the wool over someone’s eyes
Put a sock in it
Put all your eggs in one basket
Put down roots
Put it on the back burner
Put your best foot forward
Put your foot down
Put your money where your mouth is
Rain on your parade
Raise the bar
Raining cats and dogs
Red herring
Red tape
Reinvent the wheel
Right as rain
Ring a bell
Rock the boat
Roll with the punches
Run circles around
Save face
Save your breath
Scot-free
See the light
Shape up or ship out
Shoot for the stars
Shoot the breeze
Sit on the fence
Sleep like a baby
Smell a rat
Smooth sailing
Snake in the grass
Spitting image
Stand your ground
Stick to your guns
Stir the pot
Stitch in time saves nine
Stone cold
Straight from the horse’s mouth
Strike a chord
Strike while the iron is hot
Take a back seat
Take the bull by the horns
Take the cake
Take your medicine
Talk is cheap
Tell it like it is
The best of both worlds
The coast is clear
The devil is in the details
The elephant in the room
The last straw
The proof is in the pudding
The short end of the stick
The sky’s the limit
The tip of the iceberg
The whole nine yards
There’s no place like home
Throw caution to the wind
Throw in the towel
Throw under the bus
Tickled pink
Tie the knot
Tighten your belt
Time is of the essence
Time of your life
Tip of the iceberg
To each his own
To the best of my knowledge
Toe the line
Tough as nails
Turn a blind eye
Turn over a new leaf
Under the weather
Up in arms
Up the creek without a paddle
Walk a mile in someone’s shoes
Water under the bridge
We’re all in the same boat
Wear your heart on your sleeve
When the cat’s away, the mice will play
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire
Wild goose chase
With a heavy heart
Work like a dog
Worth your weight in gold
Wouldn’t touch it with a ten-foot pole
You can’t have your cake and eat it too
You can’t teach an old dog new tricks
Your guess is as good as mine
Never gonna give you up
